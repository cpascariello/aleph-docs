# Computing on Aleph Cloud

Welcome to the Aleph Cloud Computing documentation. This section covers everything developers need to know about using Aleph Cloud's decentralized computing capabilities in their applications.

## Overview

Aleph Cloud provides a decentralized computing platform that allows you to run applications and services without relying on centralized cloud providers. Our network of Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs) offers:

- **Decentralized Execution**: Run code across a network of independent nodes
- **Persistent & On-demand Computing**: Choose the execution model that fits your needs
- **Confidential Computing**: Enhanced security with hardware-level encryption
- **Web3 Integration**: Native support for blockchain applications and services

## Computing Options

Aleph Cloud offers multiple computing models to suit different development use cases:

### [On-demand Execution](/devhub/computing/on-demand/)

On-demand execution is perfect for stateless functions and microservices that need to be executed in response to specific triggers:

- Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model
- Pay only for the resources you use
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Ideal for API backends, data processing, and event-driven applications

### [Persistent Execution](/devhub/computing/persistent/)

Persistent execution provides long-running virtual machines for applications that need to maintain state and be continuously available:

- Virtual machine instances that run 24/7
- Full operating system access
- Persistent storage options
- Ideal for web servers, databases, and always-on applications

### [Confidential Computing](/devhub/computing/confidential/)

For applications handling sensitive data, Aleph Cloud offers confidential computing with hardware-level encryption:

- Memory and disk encryption using AMD SEV technology
- Protection from node operators and external threats
- Secure execution environment for sensitive workloads
- Ideal for financial applications, healthcare data processing, and privacy-focused services

## Integration with Your Applications

::: code-group

```ts [TypeScript]
import { AlephHttpClient } from '@aleph-sdk/client';
import { ETHAccount } from '@aleph-sdk/core';

const aleph = new AlephHttpClient();

// Deploy an on-demand function
const result = await aleph.program.deploy({
  name: 'my-function',
  code: `
    export default function(req) {
      return { message: 'Hello from Aleph Cloud!' };
    }
  `,
  runtime: 'nodejs16',
});

// Call the function
const response = await aleph.program.call(result.programId, {});
console.log(response); // { message: 'Hello from Aleph Cloud!' }
```

```python [Python]
from aleph_sdk_python.asynchronous import AsyncClient
from aleph_sdk_python.vm.instance import create_vm

async def deploy_vm():
    client = AsyncClient()
    
    # Create a persistent VM
    vm_hash = await create_vm(
        client=client,
        cpu=1,
        memory=2,
        disk=10,
        image_name="debian:11",
        ssh_key="ssh-rsa AAAA...",
    )
    
    print(f"VM deployed with hash: {vm_hash}")
```
