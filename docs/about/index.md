# About Aleph Cloud

Welcome to the Aleph Cloud documentation. This section provides an overview of the Aleph Cloud project, its components, and how it works.

## What is Aleph Cloud?

[Aleph Cloud](https://aleph.cloud) is an open-source off-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) network.
It offers decentralized key-value store, file storage, function execution and virtual machine provisioning.
Interactions with the network rely on decentralized identities that are interoperable with many major blockchain networks,
such as Ethereum, Tezos, and Solana.

This enables interactions between the Aleph Cloud network and blockchain networks. Bridges also allow smart contracts to
interact with the Aleph Cloud network.

Aleph Cloud also provides a blockchain indexing framework, allowing developers to index data from any blockchain network
by leveraging the Aleph Cloud network's decentralized storage and compute capabilities.

## The Aleph Cloud project has the following components:

- The Aleph peer-to-peer network, comprised of [Compute Resource Nodes or CRNs](/nodes/compute/introduction/) and [Core Channel Nodes, or CCNs](/nodes/core/introduction/)
- [Python](/devhub/sdks/python/) and [TypeScript](/devhub/sdks/typescript/) SDKs to integrate Aleph Cloud's decentralized compute and storage solutions into your project
- A [Python command-line tool](/tools/aleph-client/) to interact with the Aleph Cloud network directly from a terminal
- A [Web Console](/tools/webconsole/) to create and manage cloud resources
- A [Node Operator Dashboard](https://account.aleph.cloud/)
- A [Message Explorer](https://explorer.aleph.cloud/)

## Where to start?

- Use our [Python SDK](/devhub/sdks/python/) and [TypeScript SDK](/devhub/sdks/typescript/).
- Follow a [Tutorial to run Python code on aleph.im](/devhub/guides/computing/).
- Become part of the network by managing a [Core Channel Node](/nodes/core/introduction/) or a [Compute Resource Node](/nodes/compute/introduction/).
- Trouble setting up your node? Check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](/nodes/resources/troubleshooting/).
