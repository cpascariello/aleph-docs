# Aleph Cloud Nodes

Welcome to the Aleph Cloud Nodes documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about the different types of nodes that power the Aleph Cloud network.

## Types of Nodes

Aleph Cloud's decentralized infrastructure is maintained by two primary types of nodes:

### [Core Channel Nodes](/nodes/core/introduction/)

Core Channel Nodes are the backbone of the Aleph Cloud network. They:
- Process and validate transactions
- Maintain consensus across the network
- Store and distribute messages
- Coordinate network activities

### [Compute Resource Nodes](/nodes/compute/introduction/)

Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs) provide the computational power for the network. They:
- Execute virtual machines and containers
- Process on-demand and persistent computing tasks
- Support confidential computing with AMD SEV
- Provide decentralized computing resources

## Node Resources

Running a node on the Aleph Cloud network requires understanding various aspects of node operation:

- [Node Monitoring](/nodes/resources/monitoring/) - Tools and practices for monitoring node health
- [Troubleshooting](/nodes/resources/troubleshooting/) - Common issues and their solutions

## Getting Started

If you're interested in running a node, we recommend starting with:

1. Understanding the [requirements](/nodes/compute/requirements/) for your chosen node type
2. Following the [installation guides](/nodes/core/installation/) for setting up your node
3. Configuring your node using our [configuration guides](/nodes/core/configuration/)

## Node Rewards

Node operators are rewarded for their contributions to the network. The reward structure varies by node type and is designed to incentivize reliable operation and network growth.

For more information about the economic model and rewards, please visit the [Aleph.im website](https://aleph.im).
