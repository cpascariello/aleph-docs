# Aleph Cloud Nodes

Welcome to the Aleph Cloud Nodes documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about the different types of nodes that power the Aleph Cloud network.

## Types of Nodes

Aleph Cloud's decentralized infrastructure is maintained by two primary types of nodes:

### Core Channel Nodes

Core Channel Nodes are the backbone of the Aleph Cloud network. They:
- Process and validate transactions
- Maintain consensus across the network
- Store and distribute messages
- Coordinate network activities

### Compute Resource Nodes

Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs) provide the computational power for the network. They:
- Execute virtual machines and containers
- Process on-demand and persistent computing tasks
- Support confidential computing with AMD SEV
- Provide decentralized computing resources

## Node Rewards

Node operators are rewarded for their contributions to the network. The reward structure varies by node type and is designed to incentivize reliable operation and network growth.
