## What are Core Channel Nodes?

Aleph Cloud Core Channel Nodes (CCNs) are the fundamental building blocks of the Aleph Cloud decentralized network. They provide a secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant platform for various types of data storage and messaging services. 

Core Channel Nodes are responsible for:
- Maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of the network
- Processing and validating transactions
- Storing and sharing data
- Ensuring consensus among the participating nodes
- Serving as API endpoints for users to interact with the network

These nodes are crucial for the seamless operation of Aleph Cloud as they enable various functionalities, such as cross-chain communication, data storage, and data indexing. They facilitate the exchange of information between different blockchain networks and allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the power of Aleph Cloud.

## Network Architecture

The Core Channel Nodes form the backbone of the Aleph Cloud P2P network. Each CCN can connect to up to five Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs), which provide the actual computing and storage resources for the network.

CCNs are designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, ensuring that the Aleph Cloud network remains operational even in the face of adversarial conditions or network failures. They are governed by a set of protocols and consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior and discourage malicious actions.

## Node Operators

Aleph.im Core Channel Nodes are operated by a diverse set of participants, including individuals, organizations, and developers, which helps ensure the decentralization and security of the network. 

To become a Core Channel Node operator, participants must stake 200,000 ALEPH tokens. This stake acts as collateral, ensuring node operators remain trustworthy and provide dependable services. It's important to note that these tokens are stored non-custodially, meaning operators retain full control over their funds without any tokens being locked. If these tokens are removed from the wallet, the node will automatically be deactivated, and all community stakers will be removed from the node.

Additionally, for a node to activate on the network, it must have a total stake of 500,000 ALEPH tokens, contributed collectively by community stakers. Node operators receive rewards in ALEPH tokens for their network contributions, incentivizing continued high-quality service.

## Hardware Requirements {#hardware-requirements}

To run a Core Channel Node effectively, you'll need:

- **Processor**: Recent CPU with at least 4 cores
- **Memory**: 32 GB of RAM minimum _(64 GB recommended)_
- **Storage**: 4+ TB HDD or SSD _(ideally with at least the system on an SSD)_
- **Connectivity**: 100 MB upload bandwidth minimum _(ideally 1 GB)_

## Get started {#get-started}

If you're interested in running a Core Channel Node:

1. Follow the [Installation Guide](/nodes/core/installation/) to set up your node
2. Learn about [Node Backups](/nodes/resources/management/backups/) to ensure your data is safe

Running a Core Channel Node is a significant contribution to the Aleph.im ecosystem and helps maintain the decentralized nature of the network.
