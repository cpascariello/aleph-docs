# Aleph Cloud Staking Guide

Welcome to the Aleph Cloud staking introduction and how-to guide. This documentation will help you understand the fundamentals of staking with Aleph Cloud and guide you through the process to start earning rewards in our decentralized network.


## What is Staking with Aleph Cloud?

Staking is the heartbeat of our dynamic peer-to-peer network, driving security, decentralization, and rewards. With a minimum of **10,000 Aleph tokens**, stakeholders form the network's foundation. Rewards are distributed every **10 days** and are auto-compounded, allowing your stake to grow organically over time. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is determined by factors such as node scoring, ensuring a fair and dynamic experience.

**Important:**  
- **Core Channel Nodes (CCN):** Users can only stake on CCNs—not on Compute Resource Nodes (CRNs).  
- **Activation Requirement:** A CCN must accumulate a total of **500,000 ALEPH** in staked tokens to become active and eligible to receive rewards. Stakers will only receive rewards if the CCN’s total stake meets or exceeds this threshold.

Aleph Cloud staking empowers you to **control the controllers**, shaping decentralized connectivity while earning rewards. Plus, the staking process is **noncustodial**, meaning your tokens remain under your control at all times.


## How to Stake with Aleph Cloud

Follow these step-by-step instructions to begin staking your Aleph tokens:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Minimum Tokens:** Ensure you have at least **10,000 Aleph tokens**.
- **Supported Wallet:** Use a wallet that supports Ethereum ALEPH tokens.
- **Staking Platform:** Access the Aleph Cloud staking platform on the [account page](https://account.aleph.im).

### 2. Select a Core Channel Node (CCN)
- **Browse Available CCNs:** Navigate to the "Staking" section on the platform. Here, CCNs that have not yet reached the activation threshold (500,000 ALEPH) are listed at the top, followed by those that are already active.
- **Multiple Node Selection:** You can diversify your stake:
  - **First Stake:** Allocate your tokens to a chosen CCN.
  - **Additional Stakes:** After the initial stake, you can select another CCN. The total staked amount from your first stake will be automatically divided between the CCNs. This process can be repeated indefinitely, ensuring that even if one node fails, you don’t lose the full reward potential.

### 3. Confirm Your Stake
- **Review Details:** Confirm the details of your stake, including CCN selection and token distribution.
- **Authorize Transaction:** Submit your stake and await network confirmation.

### 4. Monitor and Manage Your Stake
- **My Stake Tab:** Once you confirm your stake, the particular CCN will show up on the **"My stake"** tab. This provides you with a clear overview of all the nodes you are staking on.
- **Reward Cycle:** Monitor your rewards, which are auto-compounded every **10 days**.
- **CCN Activation:** Regularly review the activation status of your selected CCNs to ensure they meet the **500,000 ALEPH** requirement and a minimum amount (3) of CRN's linked.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Keep an eye on performance metrics and node [scoring](/nodes/resources/scoring) to optimize your reward potential.
- **Adjust as Needed:** You can always modify your node selections or add additional nodes to diversify your stake and minimize risks.
